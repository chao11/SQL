Aggregate(合计 集合) Functions  
--------------------------------------------------------
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.
    COUNT takes the name of a column(s) as an argument and counts the number of rows where the value(s) is not NULL.
    GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
    SUM() takes the column name as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.
    MAX() takes the column name as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.
    MIN() takes the column name as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column.
    AVG() takes a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.
    ROUND() takes two arguments, a column name and the number of decimal places to round the values in that column.

Multiple tables
-------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE artists(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)

Using the CREATE TABLE statement we added a PRIMARY KEY to the id column.
A primary key serves as a unique identifier for each row or record in a given table. The primary key is literally an id value for a record.
We're going to use this value to connect artists to the albums they have produced.
By specifying that the id column is the PRIMARY KEY, SQL makes sure that:
    -None of the values in this column are NULL
    -Each value in this column is unique

A table can not have more than one PRIMARY KEY column.
